# TFSHandler
This is a tool to handle images in TFS files, used by the game Digimon World for the PSX.
With this, you can export pngs from the tfs files, import png, and save your own tfs files.
For now, it has a limited usage for simplicity, advanced options will be added later.
For instructions on how to use this tool, check [the documentation](https://github.com/uzuhenry/DigimonWorld-Translation-set)

# How to use
1.- Execute TFSHandler and load a TFS file of your choice.

2.- Save the image as PNG.

3.- Open the PNG file in your image editor. (I'd suggest GiMP)

4.- SET THE COLOR MODE TO INDEXED (Otherwise you're bound to have a palette error when importing)

5.- Edit the png file with the colors from the generated palete by your image editor. (Best practice to avoid errors)

6.- Save the file.

7.- Import the PNG file in TFSHandler.

8.- Save the new tfs file, ready to import in it's place.
